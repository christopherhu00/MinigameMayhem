This holds our Arduino code used to play on our LED board (Naturally there isn't anything yet, but it'll grow)

**PLEASE START A NEW BRANCH AND MAKE A PULL REQUEST WHENEVER YOU'RE MAKING CHANGES. IF EVERYONE DIRECTLY COMMITS TO THE MASTER BRANCH, WE'LL GET MERGE CONFLICTS, WHICH ARE UNIMAGINABLY PAINFUL.**

**Your first task is simple: add your name to the Contributors.md file using a pull request** (If you need help in making a pull request, use this link: https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

**The provided links will help you figure out how to program the NeoPixel LED strip on Arduino:**
